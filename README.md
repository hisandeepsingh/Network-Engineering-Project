# Evaluation of TCP Deoghar in WiFi environments in ns-3
## Course Code: CS821	<br/>
## Assignment: #FP5	<br/>

### Overview		<br/>
TCP Deoghar derives inferences from TCP LEDBAT [1], inorder to prevent backoff if there is a possibility that the drop was due to channel error
and has been already implemented in ns-3 [2]. This repository contains an evaluation of TCP Deoghar in a wide variety of WiFi scenarios, including Gigabit WiFi and its performance with different rate adaptation algorithms.
