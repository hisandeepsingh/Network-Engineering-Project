# Evaluation of TCP westwood,westwoodplus,LEDBAT with prposed TCP in WiFi environments in ns-3
## Subject: Network Engineering	<br/>


### Overview		<br/>
Evaluating TCP westwood [1],westwoodplus[2] and TCP LEDBAT[3] in wifi environment.I am also proposing new TCP 
 derives inferences from TCP LEDBAT, inorder to prevent backoff if there is a possibility that the drop was due to channel error
and has been already implemented in ns-3 [4].
